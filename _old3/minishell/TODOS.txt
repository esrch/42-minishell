Heredoc
- Initialize all heredocs before execution
- Still handle a heredoc that occurs before a parsing error

Execution
- Execute AST
	- Command
	- Pipeline
	- And
	- Or
- Handle redirections
- Expand shell parameters (+ split words)
- Expand wildcard (+ split words)
- Increment SHLVL environment variable
- Add executable name in error when executable name doesn't exist

Error messages
- Use program name without initial (e.g., ../test/minishell should have minishell as prompt)
- Use new error_set_custom which checks if the message is NULL

Signals

- Prevent ^C from appearing on Ctrl-C

Built-ins
